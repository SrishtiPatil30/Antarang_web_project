                        <h4>SNEHALAYA PROFILE</h4>
    
                        Snehalaya, NGO came into force by Dr. Girish Kulkarni under the guidance of 
                        Padmashree  Anna Hajare in the year 1989 at Ahmednagar. The aim was to fight against the social problems such as prostitution, child marriage, child labour, myths about HIV and many more.... With great support of volunteers they are achieving a huge success of settling nearly 20 to 22 thousand children in their lives which helped them to lead a healthy and safe life. The work is still going on and will go on till it reaches its peak, and help INDIA becoming a problem free country. The view of DR. Girish Kulkarni is appreciated by Government of India by honoring Snehalaya “Dr. Durgabai Deshmukh” national award by president of India, and “The real hero award” to Dr. Girish Kulkarni by Reliance Foundation.
                        
                        Few years back youths from Belgaum attended the youth development camp organized by Snehalaya Ahmednagar under the guidance of Shri. Anna Hazare. These camps were organized for creating social awareness and patriotism in the mind of youths because youths are the future of country. In this camp the youths from Belgaum Mr. Naresh Patil got motivated in such a way that they formed a NGO namely SNEHALAYA, Belgaum to work for the distress and destitute. In this movement social workers of Belgaum Mr Y.B.Chogule, Mr.Dhanraj Kavilkar, Mr Uday Kalghatkar Mr. Jayram Mutagekar, and Mr. Rameshwar Bhati, Premanand Gurav have joined the hands.
                        
                        <h4>SPARSH</h4>
                        
                        With the keen interest of some social workers and parents, Snehalaya planned its first project to begin “Sparsh” a school for differently able children in and around Belgaum. With few parents showing interest of self involvement in this project, today the school is successfully functioning and many special children taking education in the school. The school totally runs on donations. Sparsh has taken the challenge to bring such children out of four walls and show them the real world, which is their right.

     He met the family and became friend of that family. Both the brother and sister are good in music,and the family is depended upon the income of both blind children.
    So Mahantesh came forward to help them .He planned to open music school and orchestra.When he was in search of place he came across his friend Naresh who was working for Special children since 6 years.
     Naresh and Mahantesh planned to start music school in the premises of Snehalaya NGO at Bazar Galli,Khasbag,
     By the name ANTARANG.<br>
